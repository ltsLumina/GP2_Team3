    title: Research Log
    content: "The Daggerblade's design is centred around crystalline materials harvested
      from this planet, which shows incredible results for energy resonance. By utilizing
      these energies through a molecular-disruption field, the blade can theoretically
      cut through any known material. However, despite its potential, the weapon
      remains in an experimental phase. We should test its limits more extensively,
      but prolonged duration of this expedition has left our team exhausted, and
      resources are running very low. Right now, I can see that it\u2019s a marvel
      of engineering, but also I can\u2019t help but feel uneasy. We\u2019ve created
      something extraordinary, but we're not aware of its costs."
